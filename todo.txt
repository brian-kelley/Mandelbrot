Interactive always-responsive update:

Zooming in instantly fills in 25% of pixels, using current pixel values

-make simple quick bitset
-have bitset the size of the image for whether pixel value is computed
-initially all 0, so every pixel must be computed
-computing an image means
  -computing upper-left corner if not already computed
  -fill each non-computed pixel with nearest upper-left known pixel
  -compute all non-computed boundary pixels
  -if all boundary pixels same, fill
  -otherwise, divide in half along shorter dimension and fill each rectangle
